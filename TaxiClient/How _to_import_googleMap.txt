1.
Just follow every step mentioned in "get started" until "Obtain a Google Maps API key"
when it comes to obtain the SHA-1, it is no need to use the "key-tool".
you can obtain it on eclipse easily.
just watch the following video(from 16.25):

After u get the SHA-1, go back to "get started "and continue the remaining step.
P.S:
1.
Before running the "sample code" in module(Add a map), it is good to follow every step mentioned in "Getting Started" except obtaining the "SHA-1" in module (Obtain a Google Maps API key" module).
2.
I have encounter some unknown problems although I have run it successfully on my mobile phone somehow.
3.
Remember Google map api is not able to run on emulator.

Good luck! Hope it helps!
